# Simulation and Distributed Computing

This class introduces the Julia discrete-event simulation library SimJulia and teaches users how to run things like simulations in parallel on a computer with more than one processing core. 

# Pre-assignment:

## Update Code Repo
Update your ORC software repository (`git pull`)

##Download Julia
If you don't have Julia already installed, check out Ian and Miles' instructions at http://www.juliaopt.org/install.pdf. IJulia is recommended, but is not strictly necessary.

## Test Julia
Run the file "preassignment.jl" in the 5-simulation/ folder and submit the output in a .txt file to Stellar. 

This class assumes a working knowledge of Julia. If you're not familiar with it, check out http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.3/manual/getting-started/ and http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/.
